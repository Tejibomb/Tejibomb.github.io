            <strong>Quirk:</strong> Explosion<br><br>

            <strong>Attacks:</strong><br> <li> Blast Rush Turbo (爆速そくターボ Bakusoku Tābo?):
              Katsuki throws his hands back and uses explosions to propel himself.
              He uses this both on the ground to increase his speed and through the air to achieve a pseudo
              form of flight. He first used this technique on the ground during the Quirk Apprehension Test.
              The first time he used it to fly was during the Obstacle Race.</li><br><br>

              <li>Stun Grenade (閃光弾スタン グレネード Sutan Gurenēdo?): Katsuki starts by creating a sphere of light
                between his hands that explodes into a large scale flash. Similar to the effect of an actual
                stun grenade, the flash of light blinds anyone close by. He first used this technique to defeat
                Fumikage Tokoyami.</li><br><br>

              <li>Zero Distance Stun Grenade (ゼロ距きょ離り閃光弾スタングレネード Sutan Gurenēdo?):
              A variation where Katsuki fires off his Stun Grenade at point blank range of the opponent to
               immediately stun and immobilize them with little lasting damage. This variation was first used
               against Setsuna in the fourth round of the Joint Training Battle.</li><br><br>


               <li>Howitzer Impact (榴弾砲着弾ハウザー インパクト Hauzā Inpakuto?):
                 Katsuki takes to the air and uses explosions to propel himself in a circular motion to create a tornado.
                 This tornado builds up oxygen to fuel the incoming explosion. After colliding with the ground,
                 Katsuki releases the powerful aforementioned explosion.
                 Present Mic compared the effectiveness of the technique to that of an actual missile.
                 Katsuki first used Howitzer Impact in the final match of the U.A. Sports Festival Finals.</li><br><br>

              <li>AP Shot (徹甲弾A・P・ショット Ei-Pī Shotto?): Katsuki stretches out one of his hands
                and uses his other hand to form a circle on the palm of his outstretched hand.
                Katsuki then fires an explosion through the circle, which creates a concentrated blast beam.
                By focusing the path of his explosions into a single point instead of around his whole palm,
                Katsuki creates a concentrated blast with reduced area of impact, but with enough power to
                successfully pierce solid concrete.</li><br><br>

                <li>AP Shot: Auto-Cannon (徹甲弾A・P・ショット機関銃オートカノン Ei Pī Shotto Ōtokanon?):
                  A rapid-fire version of his AP Shot Technique. The explosion power is reduced in order to
                  avoid dealing severe damage to human targets. This variation was first used against
                  Seiji Shishikura in the first stage of the Provisional Hero License Exam.</li><br><br>

                <li>Explode-A-Pult (爆破式エクスカタパルト Ekusu Kataparuto?):
                   While in mid-air, Katsuki grabs an opponent with one of his arms,
                   then propels himself in a spinning motion by firing explosions with his free arm.
                   Once he gains enough momentum, Katsuki forcefully throws his opponent with the
                   aid of another explosion. He first used this technique against Togaru Kamakiri
                   in the fourth round of the Joint Training Battle.</li><br><br>
              </p>


      <p>
        <strong>Equipment:</strong><br>

        Grenadier Bracers (籠こ手て Kote?): An adjustment added to Katsuki's hero costume
        that stores his nitroglycerin-like sweat. Once filled he can pull the grenade pin in order to release a
        large blast, as shown when he fought Izuku in All Might's Heroes vs. Villains test. It has enough explosive
        power to destroy all parts of the building within its blast radius.
         This equipment was first used during the Battle Trial.<br><br>

        Improvised Grenades: Around the belt of his Hero costume are several
         containers made to look like hand grenades. These can store Katsuki's nitroglycerin-like sweat,
          and be used as regular grenades at a later time. These were first used in a practical way during
          the Provisional license exam by Denki.<br><br>

        Knee Pads: These are very blunt metallic attachments to Katsuki's knees.
        They are designed so he can "kill with his knees", but he has not displayed such use for them as of yet. <br><br>
